## Features

## Usage

### Initial setup

1. 

2. Create a Python 3.8 or newer virtual environment.

    *If you're not sure how to create a suitable Python environment, the easiest way is using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). On a Mac, for example, you can install Miniconda using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):*

    ```
    brew install miniconda
    ```

    *Then you can create and activate a new Python environment by running:*

    ```
    conda create -n recfinder python=3.9
    conda activate recfinder
    ```

3. Now that you have a suitable Python environment, you're ready to personalize this repository. Just run:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install recfinder
    ```
